The purpose of this website is to serve as a host where specific information is conveyed about various topics, mainly of scientific nature; in addition the activities of the QDCU 
group are presented, detailed to a sufficient level.  The hope is that the information provided here is accurate (to the best of our knowledge),  the promise is to present anything in a no-pompus way and, in any case, it will possibly be helpful to those people that are interested in dealing with such subjects. Any creative comments are wellcome.     

### Quantum Dynamics Computational Unit (QDCU)
Our research group at the [Dublin City University/School of Physical Sciences](https://www.dcu.ie/) aims to explore and describe the dynamics of atomic and molecular systems interacting with strong, ultrasort laser fields.

To this end, we formulate and implement novel computational algorithms to calculate, simulate and visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We emphasize in-house theory and algorithms development to cope with scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Dublin City University,  home to other groups with research subjects varying from plasma and lithography, material sciences to astrophysics and biophysics studies (see e.g. [School of Physical Sciences](https://www.dcu.ie/physics)). We exchange ideas, experience, work attitude with groups specializing to our research interests.

### Scientific Computing 

It goes without saying that, at present, no any challenging problem in Physics can be dealt without the use of the silicon-based computing devices; the term 'devices' may include a number of different processing units ranging from the most common, central processing units (CPUs) , Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGPs) etc and any their heteregoneous combination platform; the scale of these devices also range from simple desktop/laptop workstations to a much larger-scale supercomputing center. To deliver high performance it is not of course matter of what device is available, but also in what scientific environment this device is part of; in other words a intelligent combination of hardware, numerical algorithms and software (in that order) is a prerequisite to a Scientific Computing. 
Here the emphasis is on Linux OS and publicly available software. For a medium-size CPUs and GPUs appear the most cost-effective way of computing, hence our interest.

### Applied Analysis
This discipline aims to the study of dynamical systems and brings together a number of neighboring mathematical subfields as differential equations (partial and ordinary), variational calculus and functional analysis, linear algebra and approximation theory. Our interest relies on the study, development and application of the relevant tools for the study of real world problems.  

### Machine Learning & Artificial Neural Networks 

The nowadays availability of powerful computing platforms has allowed an alternative computational paradigm  to apply in  large scale problems of a very broad range of topics. This  highly non-linear computational method may be expressed via the artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithmic method which can also be thought as a particular implementation approach of  machine learning algorithms. Our interest here focuses in the dynamical aspects of relevant machine-learning problems.    

### Fundamentals in  Physics &  Mathematics 
Last but not least, topics that cover Physics & Mathematics concepts, methods and ideas  are also of interest both from emphasizing on the  fundamental principles that these are built on, as well as to trace the historical background that these (principles) were born..
